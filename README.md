# AI Problem Solving

Welcome to the AI Problem Solving repository! This repository contains code implementations for various AI problems, focusing on search problems, including uninformed, informed, and local search algorithms.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UdhayaShan1/AI-in-Python.git
```

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized based on different AI problems. Each problem has multiple implementations to showcase various algorithms and optimizations.

## Content
To keep it simple, for some problems we will include several types of methods such as mini-max, negamax and so on. In each file,
we will have several iterations of the same logic in (suppose to) improved performance/efficiency. 

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have additional implementations, optimizations, or bug fixes, feel free to submit a pull request.

* Fork the repository.
* Create a new branch for your changes.
* Commit your changes.
* Push your changes to your fork.
* Submit a pull request.
